# Simple Kafka Stream Application with Spring Boot 3.x and DSL

This project demonstrates the usage of Spring Boot 3.x with Kafka Streams, showcasing a simple application that involves reading data from a source topic, performing transformations, and publishing the transformed data to a destination or sink topic. The code implements the necessary configurations and stream processing logic to achieve this functionality.

## Features
- Spring Boot 3.x integration with Kafka Streams
- DSL (Domain-Specific Language) for stream processing
- JSON serialization and deserialization for efficient data mapping

## Overview
The application follows a pipeline architecture, where data flows from a source topic to various transformation stages before being published to the destination or sink topic. It leverages the power of Kafka Streams and the flexibility of Spring Boot to streamline the development process.

The key components of the application include:
- `StreamsBuilder`: Configures and builds the Kafka Streams topology.
- `JsonSerde`: Enables JSON serialization and deserialization for mapping data to and from Kafka topics.
- Source Topic: Represents the input topic from which data is consumed.
- Destination/Sink Topic: Represents the output topic where transformed data is published.
- Transformation Logic: Defines the operations performed on the data during stream processing.

## Configuration
All the application's configurations are externalized, allowing easy customization by modifying the properties file. This approach provides flexibility and ensures that specific settings can be fine-tuned according to requirements without modifying the application's code.

## Usage
1. Set up Kafka and create the necessary source and destination topics.
2. Configure the Kafka connection properties in the application's properties file.
3. Implement the desired transformation logic in the stream processing function.
4. Build and run the application.

## Conclusion
The integration of Spring Boot 3.x with Kafka Streams provides a powerful platform for developing stream processing applications. By leveraging the DSL and built-in functionalities, developers can easily implement complex data transformations and achieve seamless communication between their applications and Kafka infrastructure.
